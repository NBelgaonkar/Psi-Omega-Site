        <Paragraph>
          At RPI, students can join Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) starting in their second semester under
          the deferred recruitment system. To be eligible, you need to complete 12 credit hours with a
          minimum GPA of 2.5. Transfer students with similar academic standing are also eligible.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          DKE hosts several recruitment (or "rush") events throughout the year. These include formal
          rush events in the spring and informal gatherings during both the fall and spring semesters. 
          Attending these events is a great way to meet current brothers and learn more about the fraternity’s 
          values, activities, and membership requirements.
